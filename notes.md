Founder 🡪 are you 1 in 10 in the world?
Market 🡪 Is it growing 20%/year?
Product 🡪 Is it 10x better than the competition?
Acquisition 🡪 $0, will it grow itself through word of mouth?
Monopoly 🡪 Do you have a “network effect” whereby you become more difficult to defeat as you grow? Boolean.

Week 1: How to Talk to Users by Eric Migicovsky
Two requirements to build a business at YC: 
Code
Talk to users
The Mom Test
Do not try to persuade users during this conversation. Goal: extract data from the customer.
Talk specifics, not hypotheticals. Ask how the service has been integrated into their life. What led them to encounter this problem? What was their motivation?
Listen, don’t talk.
Five great questions to ask:
What is the hardest part about the problem their trying to solve?
Tell me about the last time you encountered this problem?
Why was this hard? (not what)
What, if anything, have you done to try to solve this problem?
What don’t you love about the solutions you’ve already tried?
Critical times to talk to users:
Got idea? 🡪 Find users with the problem
Built prototype 🡪 best first customer
Launched 🡪 find product market fit
Tips:
Take notes
Keep it casual
Careful with their time
Find numerical answers to:
How much does this problem cost them?
How often do they encounter this problem?
How large is their budget for solving this problem?
Iterate towards product market fit: “When you’ve made something that people want…when the product is being pulled by the customer, not pushed by the company.”
How would you feel if you could no longer use ___? (27:00)
3 options: measure the % of people who answer “very disappointed”
Achieve PMF if >40% of users answer “very disappointed”
Discard bad data, such as vague or fluff responses/compliments
